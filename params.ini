	Modify the *Limits* line below.
	The *Limits* below is a list of multiple independent limit, each limit has a format of
	'[PlaycountLimit, PlayTimeSoftLimit, PlayTimeHardLimit, TimeFrame, DayInWeekApply, TimeInDayApply, Name]'
	Explaination:
		PlayCountLimit: Limit the number of games to play in time frame.
		PlayTimeSoftLimit: Lower limit of total games' length in time frame.
			(Explain: If you hit game count limit but haven't hit soft limit, then you can still play.
					  For use in case of multiple "too short" 15 minutes game, enemy surrender early or afk.)
		PlayTimeHardLimit: Upper limit of total games' length in time frame.
			(Explain: Even if you haven't hit your game count limit but your total game time exceeded this value,
					  you are blocked from playing. Example: Two 50 minutes games is more than enough for a day.)
		TimeFrame: The timeframe (in hours).
		DayInWeekApply: The day of the week that this rules apply (0 = Monday to 6 = Sunday).
		TimeInDayApply: Time in the day that this rule apply (Left side is inclusive
						and right side is exclusive, E.g: [0, 8] => 0:00 to 7:59).
		Name: Pick a name for the limit, this will be shown when the limit is reached.
	Also... 24 hours = 1 day, 168 hours = 1 week, 672 hours = 1 month
